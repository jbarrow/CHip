The goal of CHip is to provide as efficient and extendible an implementation as possible. Thus, there will always be more to do to improve bottlenecks and performance, especially as I learn more.

The following are reminders to myself of things that must be completed:

- Implement c_matrix_rand() on the GPU to get a performance speedup of random number initialization.
- Look into implementing c_matrix_dist() on the GPU for a similar reason. For some reason, I believe that function pointers on the GPU provide less-than-stellar performance.
- Finish matrix and vector files.

From the list, the finished items are:

- None.
